What’s up
What’s new
What have you been up to lately
How’s it going
How are things
How’s life
I’m fine, thanks. How about you
Pretty good
Same as always
Not so great
Could be better
cant complain
I really appreciate it
I’m really grateful
That’s so kind of you
I owe you one
No problem
No worries
Don’t mention it
My pleasure
Anytime
It was nice chatting with you
Anyway, I should get going
I have no idea
I can’t help you there
Beats me
I’m not really sure
I’ve been wondering that, too
I’ve never given it much thought
I don’t have strong feelings either way
It doesn’t make any difference to me
I have no opinion on the matter
I’m not so sure about that
That’s not how I see it
Not necessarily
